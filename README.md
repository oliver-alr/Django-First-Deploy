# Django Simple Frontend and Backend Deploy :rocket:
### The easier example :+1:


>If you want to see a little example of how Django works this is a simple view for you.

This is an example of Frontend and Backend deployment powered by Python's Django web framework, I've been created a simple frontend application by myself (so simple) and created a starter backend code just for the begginers that need it. 

Please keep reading and follow the steps bellow. :point_down:

*NOTES!*

1. You must know how to initialize a Django's proyect.
2. You need to create a simple poll app into the proyect.
3. You need to create the templates and static folder in your directory.
4. Run the server inside the proyect's folder.
5. I'm using the Bash Sheel in MacOS (use -git shell- on windows). :octocat:
6. Remeber this is just an example not a tutorial, I'll hope you understand.
7. You have the code, you can modify or see how all this work behind the scenes.

*RECOMMENDATION*
